 COVID Log Graphs
###################

Linear graphs are not good at visualizing large and small numbers on the same
graph.  This is problematic for datasets like COVID cases and deaths.  

Log graphs address this by letting you visualize very large and very small
numbers on the same graph. 

This script will grab NewYorkTimes COVID data, graph is on a log chart, and
re-upload SVG data when changes were detected.
